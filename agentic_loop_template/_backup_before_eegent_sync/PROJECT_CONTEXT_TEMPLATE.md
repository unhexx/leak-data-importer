## Cycle History (Self-Improvement Log)

| Cycle | Role         | Phase    | Status     | Key Outcomes |

## Agentic Loop Self-Improvement Log

> Maintained by the **Reviewer** after each completed external cycle.  
> Focus: How effectively the agentic process itself is working.

### Critical Rule — Code Comments and Documentation (Strict)

When **any role** (especially Coder, Debugger, or Reviewer) modifies source code:

- All comments, docstrings, and documentation inside the code **must be written in natural Russian**.
- Write as a real mid/senior human developer who has been actively working on this project for several months.
- Use natural, professional Russian language.
- **Never** mention AI, LLM, agent, MiniMax, Grok, Claude, "neural network", "as an assistant", or any other indication that the changes were generated or assisted by an AI system.
- The same rule applies to git commit messages.

The Reviewer is responsible for enforcing this rule before approving a cycle.

---

## Permanent Rules (Crystallized from Experience)

> These rules must be followed strictly. They are updated by the Reviewer when new lessons are learned.

1. Re-read the full `{{ TASK_SPECIFICATION.md }}` at the beginning of every cycle.
2. Never commit broken code — only working, tested states.
3. Always populate `issues_found` in handoff JSON. Do not skip discovered problems.
4. If confidence is below 0.7 — do not hand off to the next role until uncertainty is resolved.
5. Database roundtrip tests are mandatory starting from the first cycle.

*(Add new permanent rules as they are discovered)*
