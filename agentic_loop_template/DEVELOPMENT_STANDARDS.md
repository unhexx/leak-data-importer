# DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

This document defines the non-negotiable standards for all work performed in this project, especially when using the agentic development loop.

All roles (Orchestrator, Coder, Tester, Debugger, Reviewer) must follow these rules without exception.

---

## 1. Language of Code, Comments, and Commits (Strict Rule)

**This is the most important rule in the entire agentic loop.**

When writing or modifying any source code:

- **All comments, docstrings, module-level documentation, and inline explanations must be written in natural Russian.**
- The style must be that of a real mid/senior human developer who has been actively working on this project for several months.
- Use professional, natural Russian that a real developer would actually write.
- **Absolutely forbidden**:
  - Writing comments in English
  - Using AI-typical phrasing ("As an AI language model...", "Here is the implementation...", "This function does the following...")
  - Any mention of AI, LLM, agent, MiniMax, Grok, Claude, neural network, "assisted by", or similar

**The same rule applies to git commit messages:**
- Every commit message must be written in natural Russian.
- It must sound like it was written by a real developer who understands the codebase.
- Never mention the agentic loop, AI, or any model in commit messages.

**Enforcement:**
- The **Reviewer** is responsible for catching violations.
- If non-compliant comments or commit messages are found, the Reviewer must reject the handoff and send the work back for correction.
- Repeated violations must be recorded in `SELF_IMPROVEMENT_LOG.md`.

---

## 2. Code Quality Standards

- All code must be production-grade: proper typing, error handling, logging, and meaningful tests.
- No stubs or TODO comments that block the next role.
- Prefer small, well-tested, incremental changes.
- Every meaningful change must be committed before handing off to the next role.

---

## 3. Self-Improvement Discipline

- The agentic loop exists to improve both the product **and** the development process itself.
- After every full cycle, the Reviewer must update:
  - `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` (project state + decisions)
  - `SPRINTPLAN.md` (progress and next tasks)
  - `SELF_IMPROVEMENT_LOG.md` (what the loop learned about itself)
- Lessons about prompt effectiveness, role performance, and common failure patterns must be recorded.

---

## 4. Environment and Tooling Rules

- All Python work must happen inside the local `.venv`.
- Use the provided scripts (`scripts/setup.ps1`, `agentic_loop_template/setup_env.ps1`, etc.).
- Never run Python commands using the system `python` when a virtual environment is available.

---

## 5. Handoff and Process Discipline

- Always follow the exact JSON handoff schema defined in `HANDOFF_SCHEMA.md`.
- Never skip the PLAN → ACT → REFLECT pattern inside a role.
- The Reviewer has final authority on both code quality and process adherence.

---

## 6. File Encoding (UTF-8 by Default) — Critical for Stability

**This rule exists to prevent mojibake and broken handoff files on Windows (especially Russian systems).**

All text files (including handoff JSONs, logs, reports, etc.) **must** be written and read using UTF-8.

### Mandatory Rules When Writing Files

1. **Preferred method — Python (most reliable):**
   ```python
   import json
   with open("handoff_orchestrator_to_coder.json", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
       json.dump(data, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)
   ```

2. **When using PowerShell:**
   - Always specify encoding explicitly:
     ```powershell
     Set-Content -Path "file.json" -Value $json -Encoding utf8
     "text" | Out-File -FilePath "file.txt" -Encoding utf8
     ```
   - Never rely on bare `>` or `>>` redirection without setting defaults first.

3. **Never** use:
   - Bare `echo "text" > file.json`
   - Python `open("file", "w")` without `encoding="utf-8"`
   - PowerShell redirection without explicit UTF-8

### When Reading Files

- **Recommended (and now the default after running Agent-Init.ps1)**:
  - Bare `cat file.json` or `Get-Content file.json` will now work correctly for UTF-8 files.
- Explicit form (always safe):
  - PowerShell: `Get-Content "file.json" -Encoding utf8`
- Python: `open("file.json", encoding="utf-8")`

**Note**: `Agent-Init.ps1` now sets `$PSDefaultParameterValues['Get-Content:Encoding'] = 'utf8'` so that simple `cat` commands behave as expected on UTF-8 content.

### Enforcement

- The **Reviewer** must check that all handoff JSON files and important text outputs are valid UTF-8.
- If mojibake appears in handoff files or logs, the Reviewer should treat it as a process violation and request correction.
- Record any encoding-related problems in `SELF_IMPROVEMENT_LOG.md`.

**Recommendation for the Orchestrator:**
At the beginning of every cycle, after running `Agent-Init.ps1`, ensure the current PowerShell session has UTF-8 defaults enabled.

## 7. Last Agent Completion Result File (New Artifact)

**Purpose:** Capture the human-readable "Task Completed" Markdown output (the nice summary the agent produces in the Blackbox chat when finishing a task) together with structured metadata. This provides persistence and a machine-readable record of every major task completion.

### Temporary File (always the latest)
- Location: Project root → `last_agent_completion.json`
- This file is **overwritten** on every task/cycle completion.
- It is the "конкретный временный файл" referenced in requirements.

### Archived Copy
- Location: `reports/<year>/` (e.g. `reports/2026/`)
- Filename pattern: `completion_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>_<role>_<cycle>.json`
  - Example: `completion_20260529_143022_Reviewer_5.json`
- The directory must be created automatically by the agent if it does not exist (`os.makedirs(..., exist_ok=True)` in Python or equivalent).

### JSON Structure (pretty-printed, UTF-8)
```json
{
  "project_stage": "Phase 3 — Entity Resolution & Deduplication (or current phase from PROJECT_CONTEXT / SPRINTPLAN)",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 3.1 - Implement person linker with fuzzy strategies",
    "..."
  ],
  "result_markdown": "# Task Completed\n\n## Summary\n...\n\n## What was delivered\n- ...\n\n## Next steps\n...",
  "agent_role": "Reviewer",
  "completed_at": "2026-05-29T14:30:22+03:00",
  "cycle_number": 5,
  "status": "DONE"
}
```

- `result_markdown` must contain the exact (or minimally adapted) "Task Completed" Markdown block the agent would output in the chat for the human.
- All other fields are mandatory.

### When to Create the File
- **Primary trigger:** The **Reviewer** role, when it decides the task/cycle is **DONE** and is about to output the "Task Completed" Markdown in the chat.
- The agent must:
  1. Prepare the nice Markdown summary (as it normally would for the human).
  2. Build the JSON object with the metadata above.
  3. Write `last_agent_completion.json` in the project root.
  4. Write the identical archive copy in `reports/<year>/` (creating the directory if needed).

### Writing Rules (strict)
- Follow the existing "File Encoding (UTF-8 by Default)" section in this document.
- **Strongly preferred:** Python with explicit `encoding="utf-8"` and `ensure_ascii=False` for JSON.
- PowerShell: always use `-Encoding utf8` with `Set-Content` / `Out-File`.
- Never use bare redirection or `open()` without encoding.

### Enforcement
- The **Reviewer** is responsible for creating this file as part of completing a task.
- Failure to create the file (or creating it with incorrect encoding / missing fields) is treated as a process violation.
- Record any issues in `SELF_IMPROVEMENT_LOG.md`.

**This document is the single source of truth for development standards in this project.**

When in doubt, re-read this file. The Reviewer will hold all roles accountable to these standards.
